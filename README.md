## Introduction:
In a span of few decades, the sharing of bicycle system has seen a substantial growth. This system is a recently developed transportation system which provides people with bicycle for common use. Bicycle system provides user to rent a bike from one docking station, where user can ride and then return in another docking station. Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Many countries have bike sharing system, such as Ddareungi is a bike sharing system in South Korea, which started in the year 2015, known as Seoul bike in English. It was started to overcome issues like greater oil prices, congestion in traffic and pollution in the environment and to develop a healthy environment for citizen of Seoul to live. With the advent of smart technology and convenience, the use of Rental bike is increasing every day. So, there is a need to manage the bike rental demand and manage the continuous and convenient service for the users. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. This study proposes a data mining-based approach including weather data to predict whole city public bike demand. 
## Dataset used:
The 'Seoul Bike Sharing Demand' dataset has been obtained from the UCI Archives https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand
The dataset contains weather information like Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall alongside the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.
